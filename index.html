    <p>The Soninke were the founders of the ancient empire of Ghana, which was destroyed after the invasions of Muslim conquerors in the 10th century. Their social structure and organization are typical of the Mande (q.v.) peoples.</p> 
    <p>The Soninke people are an ethnic group primarily residing in West Africa, particularly in the countries of Senegal, Mali, Mauritania, and the Gambia. They have a rich history that dates back centuries and have made significant contributions to the region.</p>
    <p>The origins of the Soninke people can be traced back to the ancient Ghana Empire, which existed from the 6th to the 13th century. The Ghana Empire was a powerful and prosperous trading state that controlled much of the trans-Saharan trade routes. The Soninke played a crucial role in the empire's rise to prominence, as they were one of the major ethnic groups that formed its core.</p>
    <p>During the 11th century, the Ghana Empire started to decline, leading to the emergence of smaller Soninke kingdoms and city-states. These included the Kingdom of Wagadou, which was the precursor to the Ghana Empire, and the Kingdom of Diara, located in present-day Mali.</p>
    <p>In the 13th century, the Mali Empire rose to power under the leadership of Sundiata Keita. The Soninke played a vital role in the Mali Empire, particularly in the areas of trade, administration, and military. The empire reached its zenith during the reign of Mansa Musa, who is renowned for his pilgrimage to Mecca and his promotion of Islam.</p>
    <p>Following the decline of the Mali Empire, the Soninke people established smaller states and kingdoms in the region. One of the most notable was the Kingdom of Kaabu, which was located in present-day Guinea-Bissau and Senegal. The Soninke also formed various dynasties and ruling families in other parts of West Africa.</p>
    <p>During the colonial era, European powers, such as France and Britain, exerted control over the territories inhabited by the Soninke people. This led to the division of the Soninke across different modern-day countries, namely Senegal, Mali, Mauritania, and the Gambia.</p>
    <p>Today, the Soninke people maintain their distinct cultural identity and continue to contribute to the social, economic, and political fabric of the countries they inhabit. They have a rich tradition of oral history, music, and art, and are known for their agricultural practices, particularly in the cultivation of millet and sorghum.</p>
    <P>The Soninke people have also played a role in the political landscape of the region. Notable figures of Soninke descent include Leopold Sedar Senghor, the first President of Senegal, and Modibo Keita, the first President of Mali.</P>
    <p>Overall, the history of the Soninke people is intertwined with the rise and fall of several prominent West African empires and kingdoms. Their contributions to trade, governance, and cultural development have left a lasting impact on the region.</p>
